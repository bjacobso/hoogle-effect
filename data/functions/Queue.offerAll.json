  "description": "For Bounded Queue: uses the `BackPressure` Strategy, places the values in\nthe queue and always returns true. If the queue has reached capacity, then\nthe fiber performing the `offerAll` will be suspended until there is room\nin the queue. For Unbounded Queue: Places all values in the queue and returns true. For Sliding Queue: uses `Sliding` Strategy If there is room in the queue,\nit places the values otherwise it removes the old elements and enqueues the\nnew ones. Always returns true. For Dropping Queue: uses `Dropping` Strategy, It places the values in the\nqueue but if there is no room it will not enqueue them and return false.",
