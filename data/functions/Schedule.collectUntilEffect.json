  "description": "Collects all inputs into a `Chunk` until an effectful condition fails.\n*Details This function creates a schedule that continuously collects inputs into a\n`Chunk` until the given effectful predicate `f` returns `false`. The\npredicate runs as an effect, meaning it can involve asynchronous computations\nlike API calls, database lookups, or randomness.",
