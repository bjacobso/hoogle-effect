  "description": "Processes an iterable and applies an effectful function to each element,\ncategorizing the results into successes and failures.\n*Details This function processes each element in the provided iterable by applying an\neffectful function to it. The results are then categorized into two separate\nlists: one for failures and another for successes. This separation allows you\nto handle the two categories differently. Failures are collected in a list\nwithout interrupting the processing of the remaining elements, so the\noperation continues even if some elements fail. This is particularly useful\nwhen you need to handle both successful and failed results separately,\nwithout stopping the entire process on encountering a failure.\n*When to Use Use this function when you want to process a collection of items and handle\nerrors or failures without interrupting the processing of other items. It's\nuseful when you need to distinguish between successful and failed results and\nprocess them separately, for example, when logging errors while continuing to\nwork with valid data. The function ensures that failures are captured, while\nsuccesses are processed normally.\n*Example",
