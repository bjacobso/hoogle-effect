  "description": "Applies a function to each element of the array and filters based on the result, stopping when a condition is not met.\nThis method combines filtering and mapping in a single pass, and short-circuits, i.e., stops processing, as soon as the function returns `None`.\nThis is useful when you need to transform an array but only up to the point where a certain condition holds true.\n*Example",
