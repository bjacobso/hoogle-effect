  "documentation": "Combines two schedules, continuing only if both want to continue, merging\nintervals using a custom function.\n**Details**\nThis function takes two schedules and creates a new schedule that only\ncontinues execution if both schedules allow it. Instead of automatically\nusing the longer delay (like {@link intersect}), this function applies a\nuser-provided merge function `f` to determine the next interval between\nexecutions.\nThe output of the resulting schedule is a tuple containing the outputs of\nboth schedules, and the input type is the intersection of both schedules'\ninput types.",
