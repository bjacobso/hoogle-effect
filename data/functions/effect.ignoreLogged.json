However, if the effect fails, it will\nlog the failure at the Debug level, so you can keep track of any issues that\narise.\n*When to Use This is useful in scenarios where you want to continue with your program\nregardless of the result of the effect, but you still want to be aware of\npotential failures that may need attention later.",
