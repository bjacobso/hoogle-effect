  "description": "Creates a schedule that tracks the total elapsed duration since it started.\n*Details This schedule executes continuously and returns the total time that has\npassed since the first execution. The duration keeps increasing with each\nstep, providing a way to measure elapsed time. This is useful for tracking execution time, monitoring delays, or\nimplementing logic based on how long a process has been running.",
