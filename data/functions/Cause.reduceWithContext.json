  "description": "Combines all parts of a `Cause` into a single value using a custom reducer\nand a context.\n*Details This function allows you to reduce a `Cause` into a single value of type `Z`\nusing a custom `CauseReducer`. A `CauseReducer` provides methods to handle\nspecific parts of the `Cause`, such as failures, defects, or interruptions.\nAdditionally, this function provides access to a `context` value, which can\nbe used to carry information or maintain state during the reduction process. This is particularly useful when the reduction process needs additional\ncontext or configuration, such as:\n- Aggregating error details with dynamic formatting.\n- Collecting logs or statistics about the `Cause`.\n- Performing stateful transformations based on the `context`.",
