  "description": "Creates an instance of `UnknownException`, an error object used to handle\nunknown errors such as those from rejected promises.\n*Details This function constructs an `UnknownException` with flexible behavior for\nmanaging the error message and cause. The required `error` argument is passed as the `cause` to the global `Error`\nconstructor, ensuring that the original cause is preserved in the error chain\nfor debugging purposes. This ensures that the origin stack trace is\npreserved. The `error` argument is always stored in the `error` property of the\n`UnknownException` instance for reference, regardless of its type. Additionally, if you provide a `message` argument, it is used as the error\nmessage. If no `message` is provided, the error message defaults to `\"An\nunknown error occurred\"`.\n*When to Use Use this function when you need to handle unexpected or unknown errors in\nyour application, particularly when the source of the error might not provide\na clear message. This is useful for wrapping generic errors thrown from\npromises or external APIs.",
