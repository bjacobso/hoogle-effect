  "description": "Zips this stream that is sorted by distinct keys and the specified stream\nthat is sorted by distinct keys to produce a new stream that is sorted by\ndistinct keys. Combines values associated with each key into a tuple,\nusing the specified values `defaultLeft` and `defaultRight` to fill in\nmissing values. This allows zipping potentially unbounded streams of data by key in\nconstant space but the caller is responsible for ensuring that the\nstreams are sorted by distinct keys.",
