  "description": "Adds annotations to each span in the effect for enhanced traceability.\n*Details This function lets you attach key-value annotations to all spans generated\nduring the execution of an effect. Annotations provide additional context,\nsuch as metadata or labels, which can help you understand and debug\nasynchronous workflows more effectively. You can either pass a single key-value pair or a record of key-value pairs to\nannotate the spans. These annotations can then be visualized in tracing tools\nthat support span annotations.",
