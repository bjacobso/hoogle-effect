  "description": "A schedule that recurs until the given effectful predicate evaluates to true.",
  "documentation": "A schedule that recurs until the given effectful predicate evaluates to true.\n**Details**\nThis schedule continues executing as long as the provided effectful predicate\n`f` returns `false`. Once `f` evaluates to `true`, the schedule stops\nrecurring. Unlike {@link recurUntil}, this function allows the stopping\ncondition to be computed asynchronously or based on external dependencies.\nThis is useful when the stopping condition depends on an effectful\ncomputation, such as checking a database, making an API call, or retrieving\nsystem state dynamically.",
