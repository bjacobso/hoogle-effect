  "description": "A schedule that recurs until the given predicate evaluates to true.\n*Details This schedule will continue executing as long as the provided predicate `f`\nreturns `false` for the input value. Once `f` evaluates to `true`, the\nschedule stops recurring. This is useful for defining schedules that should stop when a certain\ncondition is met, such as detecting a success state, reaching a threshold, or\navoiding unnecessary retries.",
