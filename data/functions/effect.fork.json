  "documentation": "Creates a new fiber to run an effect concurrently.\n**Details**\nThis function takes an effect and forks it into a separate fiber, allowing it\nto run concurrently without blocking the original effect. The new fiber\nstarts execution immediately after being created, and the fiber object is\nreturned immediately without waiting for the effect to begin. This is useful\nwhen you want to run tasks concurrently while continuing other tasks in the\nparent fiber.\nThe forked fiber is attached to the parent fiber's scope. This means that\nwhen the parent fiber terminates, the child fiber will also be terminated\nautomatically. This feature, known as \"auto supervision,\" ensures that no\nfibers are left running unintentionally. If you prefer not to have this auto\nsupervision behavior, you can use {@link forkDaemon}or {@link forkIn}.\n**When to Use**\nUse this function when you need to run an effect concurrently without\nblocking the current execution flow. For example, you might use it to launch\nbackground tasks or concurrent computations. However, working with fibers can\nbe complex, so before using this function directly, you might want to explore\nhigher-level functions like {@link raceWith}, {@link zip}, or others that can\nmanage concurrency for you.\n**Example**\n```ts\nimport { Effect } from \"effect\"\nconst fib = (n: number): Effect.Effect<number> =>\nn < 2\n? Effect.succeed(n)\n: Effect.zipWith(fib(n - 1), fib(n - 2), (a, b) => a + b)\n// ┌─── Effect<RuntimeFiber<number, never>, never, never>\n// ▼\nconst fib10Fiber = Effect.fork(fib(10))\n```",
