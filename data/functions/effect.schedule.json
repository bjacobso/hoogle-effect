  "description": "Repeats an effect based on a specified schedule.\n*Details This function allows you to execute an effect repeatedly according to a given\nschedule. The schedule determines the timing and number of repetitions. Each\nrepetition can also depend on the decision of the schedule, providing\nflexibility for complex workflows. This function does not modify the effect's\nsuccess or failure; it only controls its repetition. For example, you can use a schedule that recurs a specific number of times,\nadds delays between repetitions, or customizes repetition behavior based on\nexternal inputs. The effect runs initially and is repeated according to the\nschedule.",
