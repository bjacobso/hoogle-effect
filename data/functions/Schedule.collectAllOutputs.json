  "description": "Collects all outputs of a schedule into a `Chunk`.\n*Details This function modifies a given schedule so that instead of returning\nindividual outputs, it accumulates them into a `Chunk`. The schedule\ncontinues to run, appending each output to the collected list. This is useful when you need to track all results over time, such as logging\noutputs, aggregating data, or keeping a history of previous values.",
