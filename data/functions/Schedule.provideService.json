  "description": "Returns a new schedule with a single required service provided, eliminating\nthe need for external dependencies.\n*Details This function supplies a single service dependency to a schedule, allowing it\nto run without requiring that service externally. If a schedule depends on\nmultiple services, consider using `provideContext` instead. This is useful when working with schedules that require a specific service,\nsuch as logging, metrics, or configuration retrieval.",
