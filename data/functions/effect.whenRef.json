  "description": "Executes an effect conditionally based on the value of a `Ref` that satisfies\na predicate.\n*Details This function allows you to execute an effect only when the value of a\nspecified `Ref` meets a condition defined by a predicate. If the value\nsatisfies the predicate, the effect is executed, and the result is wrapped in\nan `Option.some`. If the predicate is not satisfied, the effect is skipped,\nand the result is `Option.none`. In both cases, the current value of the\n`Ref` is included in the result.",
