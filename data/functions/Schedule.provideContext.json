  "description": "Returns a new schedule with a provided context, eliminating the need for\nexternal dependencies.\n*Details This function supplies a required `context` to a schedule, allowing it to run\nwithout requiring external dependencies. After calling this function, the\nschedule can be used freely without needing to pass a context at execution\ntime. This is useful when working with schedules that rely on contextual\ninformation, such as logging services, database connections, or configuration\nsettings.",
