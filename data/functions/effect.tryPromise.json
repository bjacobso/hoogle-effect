This constructor is designed to handle operations that could\nthrow exceptions by capturing those exceptions and transforming them into\nmanageable errors.\n*Error Handling There are two ways to handle errors with `tryPromise`: 1. If you don't provide a `catch` function, the error is caught and the\neffect fails with an `UnknownException`.\n2. If you provide a `catch` function, the error is caught and the `catch`\nfunction maps it to an error of type `E`.\n*Interruptions An optional `AbortSignal` can be provided to allow for interruption of the\nwrapped `Promise` API.\n*Example (Fetching a TODO Item) *Example (Custom Error Handling)",
