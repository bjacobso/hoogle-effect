  "description": "Returns a new schedule that stops execution when the given predicate on the\noutput evaluates to `true`.\n*Details This function modifies an existing schedule so that it only continues\nexecuting while the given predicate returns false for its output values. Once\nthe predicate evaluates to `true`, execution stops. The output of the resulting schedule remains the same, but its duration is\nnow constrained by a stopping condition based on its own output.",
