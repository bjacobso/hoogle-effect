  "description": "Creates a schedule that recurs indefinitely with Fibonacci-based increasing\ndelays.\n*Details This schedule starts with an initial delay of `one` and increases subsequent\ndelays by summing the two previous delays, following the Fibonacci sequence.\nThe delay pattern follows: `one, one, one + one, (one + one) + one, ...`,\nresulting in `1s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s, 13s, ...` if `one = 1s`. This is useful for progressive backoff strategies, where delays grow\nnaturally over time without increasing as aggressively as an exponential\nschedule.",
