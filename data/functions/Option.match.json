  "description": "Performs pattern matching on an `Option` to handle both `Some` and `None`\ncases.\n*Details This function allows you to match against an `Option` and handle both\nscenarios: when the `Option` is `None` (i.e., contains no value), and when\nthe `Option` is `Some` (i.e., contains a value). It executes one of the\nprovided functions based on the case: - If the `Option` is `None`, the `onNone` function is executed and its result\nis returned.\n- If the `Option` is `Some`, the `onSome` function is executed with the\ncontained value, and its result is returned. This function provides a concise and functional way to handle optional values\nwithout resorting to `if` or manual checks, making your code more declarative\nand readable.\n*Example (Pattern Matching with Option)",
