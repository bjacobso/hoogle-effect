  "description": "Creates a schedule that recurs at a specific hour of each day.\n*Details This schedule triggers once per day at the specified `hour`, starting at zero\nminutes of that hour. The schedule produces a count of executions (`0, 1, 2,\n...`), indicating how many times it has been triggered. The `hour` parameter must be between `0` (midnight) and `23` (11 PM). It is\nvalidated lazily, meaning an invalid value will cause errors only when the\nschedule is executed. This is useful for scheduling daily recurring tasks at a fixed time, such as\nrunning batch jobs or refreshing data.",
