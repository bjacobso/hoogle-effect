  "description": "Create a `DateTime.Zoned` using `DateTime.make` and a time zone. The input is treated as UTC and then the time zone is attached, unless\n`adjustForTimeZone` is set to `true`. In that case, the input is treated as\nalready in the time zone. When `adjustForTimeZone` is true and ambiguous times occur during DST transitions,\nthe `disambiguation` option controls how to resolve the ambiguity:\n- `compatible` (default): Choose earlier time for repeated times, later for gaps\n- `earlier`: Always choose the earlier of two possible times\n- `later`: Always choose the later of two possible times\n- `reject`: Throw an error when ambiguous times are encountered If the date time input or time zone is invalid, `None` will be returned.",
