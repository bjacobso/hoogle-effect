  "description": "Returns a new schedule that modifies the delay before execution using an\neffectful function.\n*Details This function takes an existing schedule and applies an effectful function\n`f` to dynamically adjust the delay before each execution. The function\nreceives both the schedule's output (`out`) and the originally computed delay\n(`duration`), returning a new adjusted delay wrapped in an `Effect`.",
