  "description": "Creates a schedule that recurs once for each specified duration, applying the\ngiven delays sequentially.\n*Details This schedule executes multiple times, each time waiting for the\ncorresponding duration from the provided list of delays. The first execution\nwaits for `delay`, the next for the second value in `delays`, and so on. Once\nall delays have been used, the schedule stops executing. This is useful for defining a custom delay sequence that does not follow a\nfixed pattern like exponential or Fibonacci backoff.",
