  "description": "Combines two schedules, continuing execution as long as at least one of them\nallows it, using the shorter delay.\n*Details This function combines two schedules into a single schedule that executes in\nparallel. If either schedule allows continuation, the merged schedule\ncontinues. When both schedules produce delays, the schedule selects the\nshorter delay to determine the next step. The output of the new schedule is a tuple containing the outputs of both\nschedules. The input type is the intersection of both schedules' input types. This is useful for scenarios where multiple scheduling conditions should be\nconsidered, ensuring execution proceeds if at least one schedule permits it.",
