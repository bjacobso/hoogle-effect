  "description": "More powerful version of `Stream.distributedWith`. This returns a function\nthat will produce new queues and corresponding indices. You can also\nprovide a function that will be executed after the final events are\nenqueued in all queues. Shutdown of the queues is handled by the driver.\nDownstream users can also shutdown queues manually. In this case the driver\nwill continue but no longer backpressure on them.",
