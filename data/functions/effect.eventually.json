  "description": "Runs an effect repeatedly until it succeeds, ignoring errors.\n*Details This function takes an effect and runs it repeatedly until the effect\nsuccessfully completes. If the effect fails, it will ignore the error and\nretry the operation. This is useful when you need to perform a task that may\nfail occasionally, but you want to keep trying until it eventually succeeds.\nIt works by repeatedly executing the effect until it no longer throws an\nerror.\n*When to Use Use this function when you want to retry an operation multiple times until it\nsucceeds. It is helpful in cases where the operation may fail temporarily\n(e.g., a network request), and you want to keep trying without handling or\nworrying about the errors.\n*Example",
