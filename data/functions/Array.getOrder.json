  "description": "This function creates and returns a new `Order` for an array of values based on a given `Order` for the elements of the array.\nThe returned `Order` compares two arrays by applying the given `Order` to each element in the arrays.\nIf all elements are equal, the arrays are then compared based on their length.\nIt is useful when you need to compare two arrays of the same type and you have a specific way of comparing each element of the array.",
