  "description": "Creates a schedule that always recurs, transforming input values using the\nspecified function.\n*Details This schedule continuously executes and applies the given function `f` to\neach input value, producing a transformed output. The schedule itself does\nnot control delays or stopping conditions; it simply transforms the input\nvalues as they are processed. This is useful when defining schedules that map inputs to outputs, allowing\ndynamic transformations of incoming data.",
