  "description": "Makes a new bounded `Queue` with the sliding strategy. When the capacity of the queue is reached, new elements will be added and the\nold elements will be dropped.\n*Note: When possible use only power of 2 capacities; this will provide\nbetter performance by utilising an optimised version of the underlying\n`RingBuffer`.",
