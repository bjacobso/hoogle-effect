  "documentation": "Runs two schedules sequentially, merging their outputs.\n**Details**\nThis function executes two schedules one after the other. The first schedule\nruns to completion, and then the second schedule begins execution. Unlike\n{@link andThenEither}, this function merges the outputs instead of wrapping\nthem in `Either`, allowing both schedules to contribute their results\ndirectly.\nThis is useful when a workflow consists of two phases where the second phase\nshould start only after the first one has fully completed.",
