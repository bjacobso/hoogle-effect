After calling apply on the GroupBy object, the remaining groups will be\nprocessed in parallel and the resulting streams merged in a\nnondeterministic fashion. Up to `buffer` elements may be buffered in any group stream before the\nproducer is backpressured. Take care to consume from all streams in order\nto prevent deadlocks. For example, to collect the first 2 words for every starting letter from a\nstream of words:",
