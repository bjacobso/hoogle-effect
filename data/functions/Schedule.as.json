  "description": "Transforms a schedule to always produce a constant output.\n*Details This function modifies a given schedule so that instead of returning its\ncomputed outputs, it always returns a constant value. This is useful when you need a schedule for timing but don’t care about its\nactual output, or when you want to standardize results across different\nscheduling strategies.",
