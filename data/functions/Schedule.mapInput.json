  "description": "Transforms the input type of a schedule.\n*Details This function modifies a given schedule by applying a transformation function\nto its inputs. Instead of directly receiving values of type `In`, the\nschedule will now accept values of type `In2`, which are converted to `In`\nusing the provided mapping function `f`. This is useful when you have a schedule that expects a specific input type\nbut you need to adapt it to work with a different type.",
