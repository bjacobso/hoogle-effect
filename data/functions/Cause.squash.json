  "description": "Extracts the most \"important\" defect from a `Cause`.\n*Details This function reduces a `Cause` to a single, prioritized defect. It evaluates\nthe `Cause` in the following order of priority: 1. If the `Cause` contains a failure (e.g., from `Effect.fail`), it returns\nthe raw error value.\n2. If there is no failure, it looks for the first defect (e.g., from\n`Effect.die`).\n3. If neither of the above is present, and the `Cause` stems from an\ninterruption, it creates and returns an `InterruptedException`. This function ensures you can always extract a meaningful representation of\nthe primary issue from a potentially complex `Cause` structure.\n*When to Use Use this function when you need to extract the most relevant error or defect\nfrom a `Cause`, especially in scenarios where multiple errors or defects may\nbe present. It's particularly useful for simplifying error reporting or\nlogging.",
