  "description": "Returns a new schedule that modifies the delay between executions using a\ncustom function.\n*Details This function transforms an existing schedule by applying `f` to modify the\ndelay before each execution. The function receives both the schedule's output\n(`out`) and the originally computed delay (`duration`), and returns a new\nadjusted delay.",
