  "documentation": "Combines two schedules, continuing execution as long as at least one of them\nwants to continue, merging their intervals using a custom merge function.\n**Details**\nThis function allows you to combine two schedules while defining how their\nintervals should be merged. Unlike {@link union}, which simply selects the\nshorter delay, this function lets you specify a custom merging strategy for\nthe schedules’ intervals.\nThe merged schedule continues execution as long as at least one of the input\nschedules allows it. The next interval is determined by applying the provided\nmerge function to the intervals of both schedules.\nThe output of the resulting schedule is a tuple containing the outputs of\nboth schedules. The input type is the intersection of both schedules' input\ntypes.",
