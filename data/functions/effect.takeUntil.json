  "description": "Takes elements from a collection until the effectful predicate returns\n`true`.\n*Details This function processes a collection of elements and uses an effectful\npredicate to decide when to stop taking elements. The elements are taken from\nthe beginning of the collection until the predicate returns `true`. The predicate is a function that takes an element and its index in the\ncollection, and returns an effect that resolves to a boolean. Once the predicate returns `true`, the remaining elements of the collection\nare discarded, and the function stops taking more elements.\n*Note: The first element for which the predicate returns `true` is also\nincluded in the result.\n*When to Use Use this function when you want to conditionally take elements from a\ncollection based on a dynamic condition. For example, you may want to collect\nnumbers from a list until a certain threshold is reached, or gather items\nuntil a specific condition is met.\n*Example",
