  "description": "Collects all inputs into a `Chunk` while an effectful condition holds.\n*Details This function creates a schedule that continuously collects inputs into a\n`Chunk` while the given effectful predicate `f` returns `true`. The predicate\nreturns an effect, meaning it can depend on external state, such as database\nqueries, API responses, or real-time user conditions. As soon as the effectful condition returns `false`, the schedule stops. This\nis useful for dynamically controlled data collection, where stopping depends\non an external or asynchronous factor.",
