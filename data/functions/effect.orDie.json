  "description": "Converts an effect's failure into a fiber termination, removing the error\nfrom the effect's type.\n*Details The `orDie` function is used when you encounter errors that you do not want\nto handle or recover from. It removes the error type from the effect and\nensures that any failure will terminate the fiber. This is useful for\npropagating failures as defects, signaling that they should not be handled\nwithin the effect.\n*When to Use* Use `orDie` when failures should be treated as unrecoverable defects and no\nerror handling is required.\n*Example (Propagating an Error as a Defect)",
