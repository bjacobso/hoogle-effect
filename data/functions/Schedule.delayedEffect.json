  "description": "Modifies a schedule by adding an effectfully computed delay before each\nexecution.\n*Details This function adjusts an existing schedule by introducing a delay that is\ncomputed via an effect. Instead of using a fixed delay, each interval is\ndynamically adjusted based on an effectful function `f`, which takes the\ncurrent delay and returns a new delay wrapped in an `Effect`. This is useful for adaptive scheduling where delays depend on external\nfactors, such as API calls, database queries, or dynamic system conditions.",
