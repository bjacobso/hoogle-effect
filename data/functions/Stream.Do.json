  "description": "The \"do simulation\" in Effect allows you to write code in a more declarative style, similar to the \"do notation\" in other programming languages. It provides a way to define variables and perform operations on them using functions like `bind` and `let`. Here's how the do simulation works: 1. Start the do simulation using the `Do` value\n2. Within the do simulation scope, you can use the `bind` function to define variables and bind them to `Stream` values\n3. You can accumulate multiple `bind` statements to define multiple variables within the scope\n4. Inside the do simulation scope, you can also use the `let` function to define variables and bind them to simple values",
