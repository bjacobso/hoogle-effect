  "description": "Runs an effect and returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `Exit`,\nrepresenting the outcome.\n*Details This function executes an effect and resolves to an `Exit` object. The `Exit`\ntype provides detailed information about the result of the effect:\n- If the effect succeeds, the `Exit` will be of type `Success` and include\nthe value produced by the effect.\n- If the effect fails, the `Exit` will be of type `Failure` and contain a\n`Cause` object, detailing the failure. Using this function allows you to examine both successful results and failure\ncases in a unified way, while still leveraging `Promise` for handling the\nasynchronous behavior of the effect.\n*When to Use Use this function when you need to understand the outcome of an effect,\nwhether it succeeded or failed, and want to work with this result using\n`Promise` syntax. This is particularly useful when integrating with systems\nthat rely on promises but need more detailed error handling than a simple\nrejection.\n*Example (Handling Results as Exit)",
