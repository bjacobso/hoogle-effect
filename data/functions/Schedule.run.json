  "description": "Runs a schedule using the provided inputs and collects all outputs.\n*Details This function executes a given schedule with a sequence of input values and\naccumulates all outputs into a `Chunk`. The schedule starts execution at the\nspecified `now` timestamp and proceeds according to its defined behavior. This is useful for batch processing, simulating execution, or testing\nschedules with predefined input sequences.",
