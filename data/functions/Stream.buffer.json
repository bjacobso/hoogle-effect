  "description": "Allows a faster producer to progress independently of a slower consumer by\nbuffering up to `capacity` elements in a queue. Note: This combinator destroys the chunking structure. It's recommended to\nuse rechunk afterwards. Additionally, prefer capacities that are powers\nof 2 for better performance.",
