  "description": "Creates a schedule that repeatedly applies a function to transform a state\nvalue, producing a sequence of values.\n*Details This function starts with an `initial` value and applies `f` recursively to\ngenerate the next state at each step. The schedule continues indefinitely,\nproducing a stream of values by unfolding the state over time.",
