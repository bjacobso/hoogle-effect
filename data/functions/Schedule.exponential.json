  "description": "Creates a schedule that recurs indefinitely with exponentially increasing\ndelays.\n*Details This schedule starts with an initial delay of `base` and increases the delay\nexponentially on each repetition using the formula `base * factor^n`, where\n`n` is the number of times the schedule has executed so far. If no `factor`\nis provided, it defaults to `2`, causing the delay to double after each\nexecution.",
