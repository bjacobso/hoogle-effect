  "description": "Makes a new pool of the specified fixed size. The pool is returned in a\n`Scope`, which governs the lifetime of the pool. When the pool is shutdown\nbecause the `Scope` is closed, the individual items allocated by the pool\nwill be released in some unspecified order. By setting the `concurrency` parameter, you can control the level of concurrent\naccess per pool item. By default, the number of permits is set to `1`. `targetUtilization` determines when to create new pool items. It is a value\nbetween 0 and 1, where 1 means only create new pool items when all the existing\nitems are fully utilized. A `targetUtilization` of 0.5 will create new pool items when the existing items are\n50% utilized.",
