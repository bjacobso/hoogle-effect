  "description": "Modifies a schedule by adding a computed delay before each execution.\n*Details This function adjusts an existing schedule by applying a transformation to\nits delays. Instead of using the default interval, each delay is modified\nusing the provided function `f`, which takes the current delay and returns a\nnew delay. This is useful for dynamically adjusting wait times between executions, such\nas introducing jitter, exponential backoff, or custom delay logic.",
