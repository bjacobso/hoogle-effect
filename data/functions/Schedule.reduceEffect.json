  "description": "Returns a new schedule that effectfully folds over the outputs of this one.\n*Details This schedule accumulates outputs over time using an effectful reducer\nfunction `f`. It starts with an initial value `zero` and updates it\nasynchronously or based on external dependencies. This is useful for asynchronous state tracking, logging, external metrics\naggregation, or any scenario where accumulation needs to involve an effectful\ncomputation.",
