  "description": "Creates a schedule that recurs on a specific day of the week.\n*Details This schedule triggers at midnight on the specified day of the week. The\n`day` parameter follows the standard convention where `Monday = 1` and\n`Sunday = 7`. The schedule produces a count of executions, starting at 0 and\nincrementing with each recurrence. The `day` parameter is validated lazily, meaning errors may only be detected\nwhen the schedule is executed.",
