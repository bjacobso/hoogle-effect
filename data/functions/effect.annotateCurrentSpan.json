  "documentation": "Adds annotations to the currently active span for traceability.\n**Details**\nThis function adds key-value annotations to the currently active span in the\neffect's trace. These annotations help provide more context about the\noperation being executed at a specific point in time. Unlike\n{@link annotateSpans}, which applies to all spans in an effect, this function\nfocuses solely on the active span.\nYou can either pass a single key-value pair or a record of key-value pairs to\nannotate the span. These annotations are useful for adding metadata to\noperations, especially in systems with detailed observability requirements.",
