  "description": "Executes an effect and returns the result as a `Promise`.\n*Details This function runs an effect and converts its result into a `Promise`. If the\neffect succeeds, the `Promise` will resolve with the successful result. If\nthe effect fails, the `Promise` will reject with an error, which includes the\nfailure details of the effect. The optional `options` parameter allows you to pass an `AbortSignal` for\ncancellation, enabling more fine-grained control over asynchronous tasks.\n*When to Use Use this function when you need to execute an effect and work with its result\nin a promise-based system, such as when integrating with third-party\nlibraries that expect `Promise` results.\n*Example (Running a Successful Effect as a Promise) *Example (Handling a Failing Effect as a Rejected Promise)",
