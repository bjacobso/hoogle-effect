  "description": "Zips this stream that is sorted by distinct keys and the specified stream\nthat is sorted by distinct keys to produce a new stream that is sorted by\ndistinct keys. Keeps only values from that stream, using the specified\nvalue `default` to fill in missing values. This allows zipping potentially unbounded streams of data by key in\nconstant space but the caller is responsible for ensuring that the\nstreams are sorted by distinct keys.",
