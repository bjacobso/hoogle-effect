  "description": "Returns an effect that executes only once, regardless of how many times it's\ncalled.\n*Details This function ensures that a specific effect is executed only a single time,\nno matter how many times it is invoked. The result of the effect will be\ncached, and subsequent calls to the effect will immediately return the cached\nresult without re-executing the original logic.\n*When to Use Use this function when you need to perform a task only once, regardless of\nhow many times the effect is triggered. It's particularly useful when you\nhave initialization tasks, logging, or other one-time actions that should not\nbe repeated. This can help optimize performance and avoid redundant actions.\n*Example",
