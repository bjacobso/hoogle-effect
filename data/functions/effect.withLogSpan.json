The log span tracks the duration of\nthe wrapped effect and logs it with the specified label. This is particularly\nuseful when analyzing time-sensitive operations or understanding the\nexecution time of specific tasks in your application. The logged output will include the label and the total time taken for the\noperation. The span information is included in the log metadata, making it\neasy to trace performance metrics in logs.\n*Example",
