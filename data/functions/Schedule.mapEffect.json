  "description": "Returns a new schedule that applies an effectful transformation to its\noutput.\n*Details This function modifies an existing schedule by applying an effectful function\n`f` to its output values. The timing and recurrence behavior of the schedule\nremain unchanged, but each output is mapped to a new value within an\n`Effect`. This is useful when you need to perform side effects or asynchronous\ntransformations before passing the output forward.",
