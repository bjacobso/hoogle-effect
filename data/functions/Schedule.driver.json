  "description": "Creates a driver to manually control the execution of a schedule.\n*Details This function returns a `ScheduleDriver`, which allows stepping through a\nschedule manually while handling delays and sleeping appropriately. A driver\nis useful when you need fine-grained control over how a schedule progresses,\nrather than relying on automatic execution. The returned driver exposes methods for retrieving the current state,\nexecuting the next step, and resetting the schedule when needed.",
