  "description": "Transforms a schedule to always return `void` instead of its output.\n*Details This function modifies a given schedule so that it no longer returns\nmeaningful output—each execution produces `void`. This is useful when the\nschedule is used only for timing purposes and the actual output of the\nschedule is irrelevant. The schedule still determines when executions should occur, but the results\nare discarded.",
