  "description": "Repeats an effect a specified number of times or until the first failure.\n*Details This function executes an effect initially and then repeats it the specified\nnumber of times, as long as it succeeds. For example, calling\n`repeatN(action, 2)` will execute `action` once initially and then repeat it\ntwo additional times if there are no failures. If the effect fails during any repetition, the failure is returned, and no\nfurther repetitions are attempted.\n*When to Use This function is useful for tasks that need to be retried a fixed number of\ntimes or for performing repeated actions without requiring a schedule.\n*Example",
