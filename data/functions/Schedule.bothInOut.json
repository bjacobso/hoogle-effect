  "description": "Combines two schedules, preserving both their inputs and outputs.\n*Details This function merges two schedules so that both their input types and output\ntypes are retained. When executed, the resulting schedule will take inputs\nfrom both original schedules and produce a tuple containing both outputs. It recurs if either schedule wants to continue, using the shorter delay. This is useful when you want to track multiple schedules simultaneously,\nensuring that both receive the same inputs and produce combined results.",
