  "description": "Combines two schedules, continuing only if both schedules want to continue,\nusing the longer delay.\n*Details This function takes two schedules and creates a new schedule that only\ncontinues execution if both schedules allow it. The interval between\nrecurrences is determined by the longer delay between the two schedules. The output of the resulting schedule is a tuple containing the outputs of\nboth schedules. The input type is the intersection of both schedules' input\ntypes. This is useful when coordinating multiple scheduling conditions where\nexecution should proceed only when both schedules permit it.",
