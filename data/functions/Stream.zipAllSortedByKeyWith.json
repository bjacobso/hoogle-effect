  "description": "Zips this stream that is sorted by distinct keys and the specified stream\nthat is sorted by distinct keys to produce a new stream that is sorted by\ndistinct keys. Uses the functions `left`, `right`, and `both` to handle\nthe cases where a key and value exist in this stream, that stream, or\nboth streams. This allows zipping potentially unbounded streams of data by key in\nconstant space but the caller is responsible for ensuring that the\nstreams are sorted by distinct keys.",
