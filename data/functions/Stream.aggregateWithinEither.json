  "description": "Aggregates elements using the provided sink until it completes, or until\nthe delay signalled by the schedule has passed. This operator divides the stream into two asynchronous islands. Operators\nupstream of this operator run on one fiber, while downstream operators run\non another. Elements will be aggregated by the sink until the downstream\nfiber pulls the aggregated value, or until the schedule's delay has passed. Aggregated elements will be fed into the schedule to determine the delays\nbetween pulls.",
