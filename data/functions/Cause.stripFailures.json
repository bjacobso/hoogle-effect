  "description": "Removes `Fail` and `Interrupt` nodes from a `Cause`, keeping only defects\n(`Die`).\n*Details This function is similar to `keepDefects` but returns a `Cause<never>`\ndirectly, which can still store `Die` or finalizer-related defects. It's\nhelpful for analyzing only the irrecoverable portion of the error.",
