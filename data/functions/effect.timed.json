The result of the new effect includes both the execution time (as a\n`Duration`) and the original effect's result. This is useful for monitoring\nperformance or gaining insights into the time taken by specific operations. The original effect's behavior (success, failure, or interruption) remains\nunchanged, and the timing information is provided alongside the result in a\ntuple.\n*Example",
