  "description": "Evaluates and runs each effect in the iterable, collecting only the\nsuccessful results while discarding failures.\n*Details This function function processes an iterable of effects and runs each one. If\nan effect is successful, its result is collected; if it fails, the result is\ndiscarded. This ensures that only successful outcomes are kept.\n*Options The function also allows you to customize how the effects are handled by\nspecifying options such as concurrency, batching, and how finalizers behave.\nThese options provide flexibility in running the effects concurrently or\nadjusting other execution details.\n*Example",
