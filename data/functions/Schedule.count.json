  "description": "A schedule that recurs indefinitely, counting the number of recurrences.\n*Details This schedule never stops and simply counts how many times it has executed.\nEach recurrence increases the count, starting from `0`. This is useful when tracking the number of attempts in retry policies,\nmeasuring execution loops, or implementing infinite polling scenarios.",
