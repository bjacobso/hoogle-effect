  "description": "Attaches a finalizer to a schedule that runs when the schedule completes.\n*Details This function returns a new schedule that executes a given finalizer when the\nschedule reaches completion. Unlike `Effect.ensuring`, this method does not\nguarantee the finalizer will run in all cases. If the schedule never\ninitializes or is not driven to completion, the finalizer may not execute.\nHowever, if the schedule decides not to continue, the finalizer will be\ninvoked. This is useful for cleaning up resources, logging, or executing other side\neffects when a schedule completes.",
