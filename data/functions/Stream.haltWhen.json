  "description": "Halts the evaluation of this stream when the provided effect completes. The\ngiven effect will be forked as part of the returned stream, and its success\nwill be discarded. An element in the process of being pulled will not be interrupted when the\neffect completes. See `interruptWhen` for this behavior. If the effect completes with a failure, the stream will emit that failure.",
