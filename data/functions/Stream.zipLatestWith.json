  "description": "Zips the two streams so that when a value is emitted by either of the two\nstreams, it is combined with the latest value from the other stream to\nproduce a result. Note: tracking the latest value is done on a per-chunk basis. That means\nthat emitted elements that are not the last value in chunks will never be\nused for zipping.",
