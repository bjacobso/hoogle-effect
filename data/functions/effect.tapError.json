  "description": "Execute a side effect on failure without modifying the original effect.\n*Details This function allows you to inspect and react to the failure of an effect by\nexecuting an additional effect. The failure value is passed to the provided\nfunction, enabling you to log it, track it, or perform any other operation.\nImportantly, the original failure remains intact and is re-propagated, so the\neffect's behavior is unchanged. The side effect you provide is only executed when the effect fails. If the\neffect succeeds, the function is ignored, and the success value is propagated\nas usual.\n*Example",
