  "description": "Creates a long-running background fiber that is independent of its parent.\n*Details This function creates a \"daemon\" fiber that runs in the background and is not\ntied to the lifecycle of its parent fiber. Unlike normal fibers that stop\nwhen the parent fiber terminates, a daemon fiber will continue running until\nthe global scope closes or the fiber completes naturally. This makes it\nuseful for tasks that need to run in the background independently, such as\nperiodic logging, monitoring, or background data processing.\n*Example (Creating a Daemon Fiber)",
