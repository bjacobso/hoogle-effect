  "description": "Repeatedly updates a state through an effectful operation until a condition\nis no longer met.\n*Details This function provides a way to implement effectful loops, similar to a\n`while` loop in JavaScript. It starts with an initial state, checks a\ncondition (`while`), and executes a body operation to update the state if the\ncondition evaluates to `true`. The process repeats until the condition\nreturns `false`. The state is passed between iterations, allowing the body operation to modify\nit dynamically. The final state after the loop ends is returned as the result\nof the effect.\n*When to Use This is particularly useful for scenarios where looping logic involves\nasynchronous or side-effectful operations, such as polling or iterative\ncomputations that depend on external factors.\n*Example (Effectful Iteration)",
