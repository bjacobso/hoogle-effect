  "description": "Searches a `Cause` using a partial function to extract information.\n*Details This function allows you to search through a `Cause` using a custom partial\nfunction. The partial function is applied to the `Cause`, and if it matches,\nthe result is returned wrapped in a `Some`. If no match is found, the result\nis `None`. This is particularly useful when you are only interested in specific types of\nerrors, defects, or interruption causes within a potentially complex `Cause`\nstructure. By leveraging a partial function, you can focus on extracting only\nthe relevant information you care about. The partial function should return an `Option` indicating whether it matched\nand the value it extracted.",
