  "description": "Sequentially combines two effects using a specified combiner function while\naccumulating errors.\n*Details This function combines two effects, `self` and `that`, into a single effect\nby applying the provided combiner function to their results. If both effects\nsucceed, the combiner function is applied to their results to produce the\nfinal value. If either effect fails, the failures are accumulated into a\ncombined `Cause`. By default, effects are executed sequentially. However, the execution mode\ncan be controlled using the `options` parameter to enable concurrency,\nbatching, or customized finalizer behavior.",
