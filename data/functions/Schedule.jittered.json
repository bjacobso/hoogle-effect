  "description": "Returns a new schedule that randomly adjusts the interval size within a\nrange.\n*Details This function modifies a schedule so that its delay between executions is\nrandomly varied within a range. By default, the delay is adjusted between\n`80%` (`0.8 * interval`) and `120%` (`1.2 * interval`) of the original\ninterval size. This is useful for adding randomness to repeated executions, reducing\ncontention in distributed systems, and avoiding synchronized execution\npatterns that can cause bottlenecks.",
