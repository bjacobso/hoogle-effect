  "documentation": "Executes an effect synchronously, running it immediately and returning the\nresult.\n**Details**\nThis function evaluates the provided effect synchronously, returning its\nresult directly. It is ideal for effects that do not fail or include\nasynchronous operations. If the effect does fail or involves async tasks, it\nwill throw an error. Execution stops at the point of failure or asynchronous\noperation, making it unsuitable for effects that require asynchronous\nhandling.\n**Important**: Attempting to run effects that involve asynchronous operations\nor failures will result in exceptions being thrown, so use this function with\ncare for purely synchronous and error-free effects.\n**When to Use**\nUse this function when:\n- You are sure that the effect will not fail or involve asynchronous\noperations.\n- You need a direct, synchronous result from the effect.\n- You are working within a context where asynchronous effects are not\nallowed.\nAvoid using this function for effects that can fail or require asynchronous\nhandling. For such cases, consider using {@link runPromise}or\n{@link runSyncExit}.\n**Example** (Synchronous Logging)\n```ts\nimport { Effect } from \"effect\"\nconst program = Effect.sync(() => {\nconsole.log(\"Hello, World!\")\nreturn 1\n})\nconst result = Effect.runSync(program)\n// Output: Hello, World!\nconsole.log(result)\n// Output: 1\n```\n**Example** (Incorrect Usage with Failing or Async Effects)\n```ts\nimport { Effect } from \"effect\"\ntry {\n// Attempt to run an effect that fails\nEffect.runSync(Effect.fail(\"my error\"))\n} catch (e) {\nconsole.error(e)\n}\n// Output:\n// (FiberFailure) Error: my error\ntry {\n// Attempt to run an effect that involves async work\nEffect.runSync(Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(1)))\n} catch (e) {\nconsole.error(e)\n}\n// Output:\n// (FiberFailure) AsyncFiberException: Fiber #0 cannot be resolved synchronously. This is caused by using runSync on an effect that performs async work\n```",
