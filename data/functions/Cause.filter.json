  "description": "Preserves parts of a `Cause` that match a given predicate.\n*Details This function allows you to retain only the parts of a `Cause` structure that\nmatch a specified predicate or refinement. Any parts of the `Cause` that do\nnot match the provided condition are excluded from the result. You can use this function in two ways:\n- With a `Predicate`: A function that evaluates whether a `Cause` should be\nretained based on its value.\n- With a `Refinement`: A more specific predicate that can refine the type of\nthe `Cause`. This is useful when you need to extract specific types of errors, defects, or\ninterruptions from a `Cause` while discarding unrelated parts.",
