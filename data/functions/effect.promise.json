You can think of it similar to an unexpected\ncrash in the program, which can be further managed or logged using tools like\n{@link catchAllDefect}.\n**Interruptions**\nAn optional `AbortSignal` can be provided to allow for interruption of the\nwrapped `Promise` API.\n**When to Use**\nUse this function when you are sure the operation will not reject.\n**Example** (Delayed Message)\n```ts\nimport { Effect } from \"effect\"\nconst delay = (message: string) =>\nEffect.promise<string>(\n() =>\nnew Promise((resolve) => {\nsetTimeout(() => {\nresolve(message)\n}, 2000)\n})\n)\n// ┌─── Effect<string, never, never>\n// ▼\nconst program = delay(\"Async operation completed successfully!\")\n```",
