  "description": "Chains two schedules, passing the output of the first as the input to the\nsecond, while selecting the shorter delay between them.\n*Details This function composes two schedules so that the output of the first schedule\nbecomes the input of the second schedule. The first schedule executes first,\nand once it produces a result, the second schedule receives that result and\ncontinues execution based on it. This is useful for building complex scheduling workflows where one schedule's\nbehavior determines how the next schedule behaves.",
