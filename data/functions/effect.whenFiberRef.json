  "description": "Executes an effect conditionally based on the value of a `FiberRef` that\nsatisfies a predicate.\n*Details This function enables you to execute an effect only when the value of a\nspecified `FiberRef` meets a certain condition defined by a predicate. If the\nvalue satisfies the predicate, the effect is executed, and the result is\nwrapped in an `Option.some`. If the predicate is not satisfied, the effect is\nskipped, and the result is `Option.none`. In both cases, the current value of\nthe `FiberRef` is included in the result.",
