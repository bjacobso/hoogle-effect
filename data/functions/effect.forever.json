  "description": "Repeats an effect indefinitely until an error occurs.\n*Details This function executes an effect repeatedly in an infinite loop. Each\niteration is executed sequentially, and the loop continues until the first\nerror occurs. If the effect succeeds, it starts over from the beginning. If\nthe effect fails, the error is propagated, and the loop stops. Be cautious when using this function, as it will run indefinitely unless an\nerror interrupts it. This makes it suitable for long-running processes or\ncontinuous polling tasks, but you should ensure proper error handling or\ncombine it with other operators like `timeout` or `schedule` to prevent\nunintentional infinite loops.",
