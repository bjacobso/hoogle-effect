  "description": "Combines all errors from concurrent operations into a single error.\n*Details This function is used when you have multiple operations running at the same\ntime, and you want to capture all the errors that occur across those\noperations. Instead of handling each error separately, it combines all the\nerrors into one unified error.\n*When to Use When using this function, any errors that occur in the concurrently running\noperations will be grouped together into a single error. This helps simplify\nerror handling in cases where you don't need to differentiate between each\nfailure, but simply want to know that multiple failures occurred.\n*Example",
