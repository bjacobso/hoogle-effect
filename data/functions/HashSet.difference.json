Time complexity: `O(n)` where n is the number of elements in the set\n*NOTE: the hash and equal of the values in both the set and the iterable\nmust be the same; meaning we cannot compute a difference between a `HashSet\nof bananas` and a `HashSet of elephants` as they are not the same type and\nwon't implement the Equal trait in the same way.",
