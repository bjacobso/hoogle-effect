  "description": "Aggregates elements of this stream using the provided sink for as long as\nthe downstream operators on the stream are busy. This operator divides the stream into two asynchronous \"islands\". Operators\nupstream of this operator run on one fiber, while downstream operators run\non another. Whenever the downstream fiber is busy processing elements, the\nupstream fiber will feed elements into the sink until it signals\ncompletion. Any sink can be used here, but see `Sink.foldWeightedEffect` and\n`Sink.foldUntilEffect` for sinks that cover the common usecases.",
