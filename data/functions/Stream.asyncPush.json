  "description": "Creates a stream from an external push-based resource. You can use the `emit` helper to emit values to the stream. The `emit` helper\nreturns a boolean indicating whether the value was emitted or not. You can also use the `emit` helper to signal the end of the stream by\nusing apis such as `emit.end` or `emit.fail`. By default it uses an \"unbounded\" buffer size.\nYou can customize the buffer size and strategy by passing an object as the\nsecond argument with the `bufferSize` and `strategy` fields.",
