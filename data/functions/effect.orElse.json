The fallback\neffect is defined as a lazy argument, meaning it will only be evaluated if\nthe first effect fails. This provides a way to recover from errors by\nspecifying an alternative path of execution. The error type of the resulting effect will be that of the fallback effect,\nas the first effect's error is replaced when the fallback is executed.\n*Example",
